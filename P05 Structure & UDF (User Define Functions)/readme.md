Write a function that takes your birth date as input and displays your age in terms of years, months, and days. (Use Structure for date)

## 15. Date Validation

Write a function to validate a date given by the user. The function returns 0 for a valid date and returns 1 otherwise.

## 16. Date Comparison

Write a function that compares two given dates. If the dates are equal then it must return 0 else return 1. (Use Structure for date)

## 17. Time Management

Define a structure data type called time containing three members hour, minute, second. Develop a UDF for the following tasks:
a. Create a function Input() to take input of the time from the user.
b. Create a function Display() to display the time entered by the user.
c. Create a function Validate() that accepts one argument of time type and returns 0 if it is valid, otherwise, it returns 1.
