# C++ Programming Practice Problems - Time & Space Complexity

This repository contains solutions to various programming problems implemented in C++. The focus is on analyzing their time and space complexity.

## Problem 1: Find the Duplicate Element

**Given:** An array `arr` of size `N` containing integers from 1 to `N`. One element appears twice.

**Task:** Find the duplicate element in the array.

**Method : 1** Slow (High Time Complexity)

**Method : 2** Space Inefficient (High Space Complexity)

**Method : 3** Optimal Solution (Fast & Space-Saving)
