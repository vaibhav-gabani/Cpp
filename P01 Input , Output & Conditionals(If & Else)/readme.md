     - Percentage above or equal to 60 → First Division
     - Percentage between 50 and 59 → Second Division
     - Percentage between 40 and 49 → Third Division
     - Percentage less than 40 → Fail

2. **Employee Bonus**
   - A company decides to pay a bonus to its employee as per the following rules:
     - Years of service more than 7 → Rs. 5000
     - Years of service between 4 & 6 → Rs. 3000
     - Years of service between 1 & 3 → Rs. 1000
     - Years of service less than 1 → Not eligible for bonus
   - If the current year and the year of joining are input through the keyboard, calculate the bonus received by an employee.

3. **Factory Worker Payment**
   - The workers in a factory are paid according to the following rules:
     - Regular working hours are 40, paid at the rate of Rs. 2.50 per hour.
     - If overtime hours are between 1 & 5 → Rs. 7.00 per hour
     - If overtime hours are between 6 & 10 → Rs. 8.50 per hour
     - If overtime hours are above 10 → Rs. 12.00 per hour
   - If the number of hours worked is input by the user, find out the payment made to the employee.

4. **Largest Among Three Variables**
   - Write a program to find the largest among three variables.

5. **Simple Interest Calculation**
   - If Principal, number of years, and rate of interest are taken as input from the user, write a C++ program for calculating the simple interest (SI = P * R * N / 100).

6. **Gross Salary Calculation**
   - The basic salary of an employee is entered by the user. If the dearness allowance is 40% of the basic salary and house rent allowance is 20% of basic, Medical allowance is 5% of basic, write a C++ Program to calculate the gross salary.

7. **Distance Conversion**
   - The distance between two cities (in Km) is entered by the user. Write a C++ Program to convert & print this distance in meters, feet, inches, and centimeters.

8. **Population Calculation**
   - The population of a city in India at the beginning of 2013 is entered by the user. The population changes as per the following pattern:
     - At the end of 2014 - 10% increase
     - At the end of 2015 – 10% decrease
     - At the end of 2016 – 11.23 % increase
     - At the end of 2017 – remains constant
     - At the end of 2018 – decreases by 4.2%
   - Write a C++ Program to calculate the population at the end of 2018.

9. **Temperature Conversion**
   - The temperature of the city is entered by the user in Fahrenheit. Write a C++ Program to convert this temperature into centigrade degrees.

10. **Equation Evaluation**
    - A mathematics student has three equations as follows:
      1. z + c = a^2 + 2ab
      2. 2ac = b^2 - x - 2z
      3. y = z + 5x - 2yb + k
    - Values of a, b, c, and y are entered by the user. Write a C++ Program to evaluate k.

11. **Employee Bonus Check**
    - The year of joining of an employee and the current year are entered by the user. If the years of service are greater than 3 then the employee is given a bonus of Rs. 5000. Write a C++ Program to print the bonus only if the years of service are greater than 3.

12. **Factory Worker Payment (Extended)**
    - The workers in the factory are paid according to the following rules:
      - Regular working hours are 48 in a week, paid at the rate of 50 per hour.
      - For working overtime (above 48 hours), the payment will be made as under:
        - If overtime hours are between 1 & 5 → Rs. 70 per hour
        - If overtime hours are between 6 & 10 → Rs. 85 per hour
        - If overtime hours are above 10 → Rs. 120 per hour.
    - If the number of hours worked is entered by the user, write a C++ Program to find out the payment made to the employee.

13. **Bank Interest Calculation**
    - A bank pays interest according to the following manner:
      - If the amount is more than 100000, then interest rate = 12%
      - If the amount is >=60000 & <100000, then interest rate = 10%
      - If the amount is >=30000 & <60000, then interest rate = 8%
      - If the amount is <30000, then interest rate = 7.2%
    - If the amount is entered by the user, write a C++ Program to calculate the interest the customer would get.

14. **Atmosphere Evaluation**
    - If the temperature of a city is entered by the user in Fahrenheit degrees, determine how the atmosphere of the city is according to the following rules:
      - If temperature is above 40 degrees → very hot
      - If temperature is <40 & >=37 → Hot
      - If temperature is >=34 & <37 → Warm
      - If temperature is <34 → cool

15. **Leap Year Check**
    - Write a C++ Program to check whether the year entered by the user is a leap year or not.

16. **Month Display**
    - Write a C++ Program to display a month corresponding to a number entered by the user. For example, 1→January 2→February etc..
